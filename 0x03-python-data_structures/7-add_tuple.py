# When creating a tuple with one item, add a comma at the end.
# The len function can be used to get the length of a tuple.
# Accessing items in a tuple works similar to a list, using indexes.
# A python tuple can be reassigned with a different value.
# To join two or more tuples you can use the + operator.
# Unpacking a tuple means splitting the tupleâ€™s elements into individual
# variables. Example x, y = (1, 2) The left side: x, y is a tuple of two
# variables x and y. The right side is also a tuple of two integers 1 and 2.
