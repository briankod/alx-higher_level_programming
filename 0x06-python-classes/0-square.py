# We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. Syntax:
# class class_name:
#     '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
#     <statement 1>
#     <statement 2>
#     .
#     .
#     <statement N>
# class_name: It is the name of the class
# Docstring: It is the first string inside the class and has a brief
# description of the class. Although not mandatory, this is
# highly recommended.
# statements: Attributes and method
# The pass statement in classes serves as empty code inside the classes without
# causing any error, however, objects of the empty classes can be created.
